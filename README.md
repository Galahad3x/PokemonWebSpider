# Pokemon Web Crawler

## DailyHack HackEPS 2019 - Galahad_3x

#### Basic info:
Pokemon Web Crawler made using Python 3.6 and Beautiful Soup 4. The program creates a pokémon team with 6 members, all of them must have double-type and the types must not repeat. Also there can't be pokemons from the same evolution chain.
> IMPORTANT: The program considers a pokémon and its megaevolution as the same pokemon, since the have the same Pokedex ID.  

#### How to run:
The program has been made using the PyCharm IDE. The program can be run from an IDE or by typing in the bash terminal:
```bash
python3 PokemonWebSpider.py
```
> Since the program has to open a lot of webs, it takes a long time to run the program. Be patient :)  
The result of running the program will be an html file called result.html, that can be opened by double-clicking it.
